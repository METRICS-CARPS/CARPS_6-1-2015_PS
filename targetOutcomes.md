For this article you should focus on the findings reported in section "Effects of crowding on perception and
action" for Experiment 1.

Specifically, you should attempt to reproduce all descriptive and inferential analyses reported in the text below and associated tables/figures:

> Effects of crowding on perception and action

> Experiment 1 was designed to explore the effects of
crowding on perception and action, with a particular focus on whether participants could scale their grip aperture
to the size of the target even when they could not
consciously identify the size of the target. We carried out
a four-way repeated measures ANOVA on the manual
estimates and PGAs with task (estimation vs. grasping),
crowding condition (uncrowded vs. crowded), viewing
condition (closed- vs. open-loop), and target size (3.0 vs.
3.75 cm) as main factors. The significant interaction
between task and crowding condition, F(1, 9) = 6.818,
p = .028, suggested that crowding had different effects on
performance of the grasping and manual estimation
tasks. Not surprisingly, when the target was presented in
isolation, participants were able to manually estimate the
sizes of the two targetsâ€”and this was true for both
closed-loop trials, t(9) = 7.23, p < .001, and open-loop
trials, t(9) = 9.19, p < .001. Similarly, participants showed
excellent grip scaling for targets presented in isolation on both closed-loop trials, t(9) = 4.29, p = .002, and openloop trials, t(9) = 4.79, p = .001 (Fig. 3).
Things were quite different, however, when the target disks were surrounded by flankers. In this condition, participants could no longer discriminate between the two disk sizes using a manual estimate closed-loop trials: t(9) = 1.02, p = .334; open-loop trials: t(9) = 1.78, p = .108?presumably because the size of the target was per- ceptually invisible. (Note that we use the term invisible to refer to the fact that participants could not identify the size of the target, even though they were aware of its presence and position.) In contrast, when participants were asked to grasp the same targets, their PGAs were still scaled to target size?closed-loop trials: t(9) = 4.21, p = .002; open-loop trials: t(9) = 3.392, p = .008 (Fig. 3).
